# World Happiness Report Analysis
Using the World Happiness Report and especially, the Happiness Scores published, this project attempts to find the "secret" of happy nations in their social environments. In order to do so, it attempts to understand which of the popularly-mentioned environmental variables ( Log GDP per capita, Life Expectancy, Perceptions on Corruption, Social Support, Freedom to make choices and Generosity) are important i.e. significantly associated, and how do they relate to the odds of being happier. It also strives to understand the more influential ones. Further, it aspires to unravel the regional variations. It tries to understand whether belonging to one region or the other makes a difference. Also, it attempts to understand which factors matter differently across regions and how does the belonging to one region or the other change their associations to the odds of being happier.

The report uses a region-level proportional odds model for the analysis. It begins with data preprocessing followed by EDA, and tries developing the model aided by an imputed data AIC Stepwise-built single-level model, guided by statistical significance and plausibility.
